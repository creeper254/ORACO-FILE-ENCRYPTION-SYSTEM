##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Flask 3.1.1+
- Cryptography 45.0.5+
- Werkzeug 3.1.3+

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone/Download the project**
   ```bash
   # All files are already in your current directory
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install flask cryptography werkzeug
   ```

3. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Access the System**
   - Open your browser to `http://localhost:5000`
   - Default admin credentials:
     - Username: `admin`
     - Password: `admin123`

##  User Roles

### Admin Users
- Access to admin dashboard
- User management (add, view, manage users)
- System logs monitoring
- File oversight across organization
- System statistics and monitoring

### Regular Users
- File encryption and upload
- File decryption and download
- File sharing with other users
- Personal activity history
- Password management

##  Core Functionality

### File Encryption Process
1. User uploads file with encryption password
2. System generates salt and derives key using PBKDF2
3. File encrypted using AES-256 via Fernet
4. Original file deleted, encrypted version stored
5. Activity logged with user details

### File Decryption Process
1. User requests file download with password
2. System extracts salt from encrypted file
3. Key derived from password and salt
4. File decrypted and served to user
5. Access logged and counters updated

### Security Features
- **Password Hashing**: Werkzeug's secure password hashing
- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2 with SHA-256, 100,000 iterations
- **Salt Generation**: Cryptographically secure random salts
- **Session Management**: Secure Flask sessions
- **Activity Logging**: Complete audit trail
- **File Access Control**: Owner and sharing permissions

##  Database Schema

### Users Table
- User credentials and profile information
- Role-based access control
- Password reset token management
- Activity tracking (last login, creation date)

### Files Table
- File metadata and encryption details
- Owner and sharing information
- Access statistics and timestamps
- Encryption key hash for verification

### Activity Logs Table
- Complete user activity audit trail
- IP address tracking
- Timestamp and action details
- System security monitoring

##  Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `FLASK_SECRET_KEY`: Flask session secret (auto-generated if not set)

### File Upload Settings
- **Max File Size**: 16MB
- **Allowed Types**: TXT, PDF, PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, DOC, DOCX, XLS, XLSX
- **Storage**: Encrypted files stored in `encrypted_files/` directory

### Security Settings
- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256
- **Iterations**: 100,000
- **Salt Length**: 16 bytes
- **Encryption**: AES-256 via Fernet

##  Usage Examples

### Admin Tasks
1. **Add New User**
   - Login as admin → Admin Dashboard → Add New User
   - Fill in user details and assign role

2. **Monitor System Activity**
   - Admin Dashboard → System Logs
   - View real-time user activities and file operations

3. **Manage Users**
   - Admin Dashboard → Manage Users
   - View all users, their status, and last login times

### User Tasks
1. **Encrypt and Upload File**
   - Dashboard → Upload File
   - Select file, enter strong password, optionally share
   - File encrypted with AES-256 and stored securely

2. **Download and Decrypt File**
   - Dashboard → View Files → Download
   - Enter correct password to decrypt and download

3. **Share Files**
   - During upload, select users to share with
   - Shared users can decrypt with the same password

## Security Best Practices

1. **Strong Passwords**: Use complex passwords for encryption
2. **Regular Monitoring**: Check system logs regularly
3. **User Management**: Remove inactive users promptly
4. **Backup Strategy**: Regular database backups recommended
5. **Network Security**: Use HTTPS in production
